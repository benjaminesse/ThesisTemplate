\section*{Paper Summary}

A description of the paper goes here.

\clearpage % Start a new page after the paper info

% Begin the reference section. This allows a separate bibliography at the end
% of the paper chapter. Use refsegment to include references in final
% bibliography and refsection to only include in the chapter bibliography
\begin{refsegment}

This is where the chapter text goes... In-line references are done like this: \citet{Horvath2011}, while those with parenthesis are like this \citep{Horvath2011}. Note these references will exist in both the chapter and main bibliographies.

Here is Table \ref{ch2:tab:table1}

\begin{table}[h]

    \caption[Short caption for the List of Tables]{Long caption to go with the table.}

    \label{ch2:tab:table1}

    \begin{tabular}{c c}

        \hline

         Title 1 & Title 2  \\

         \hline
